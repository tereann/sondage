# Survey Web Service Project

This is a web service project that is designed to eventually make a survey. 
Currently, the project only has one entity class called "Sondage", which represents a survey.

The project includes JUnit tests to test each interaction with the Sondage entity, 
including creating a new Sondage, updating an existing Sondage, getting a list of all Sondages, 
getting one particular Sondage using id 
and deleting a Sondage.

Future development of this project will include additional entity classes, 
as well as the ability to create, respond to, and analyze surveys.
